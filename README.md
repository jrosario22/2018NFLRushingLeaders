# 2018 NFL Rushing Leaders

## Project Info

I am taking a deep analysis of the 2018 National Football League's Rushing Leaders using data science techniques to get a better understanding of the running aspect of the game of football. 

In addition, I wanted to learn Python and dive into the world of data science.

## Missing Data & Distribution Plots

I look for missing data and take a look at:

- Number of players who scored touchdowns
- Rushing leaders per team
- Age of rushing leaders
- Top 10 quarterbacks that lead in rushing yards
- Distribution of total rushing yards

## Outliers & Multi-Variable Plots

When analysizing the relationship between age and total yards, I found some outlier that needed a closer look. I also examine the relationships between:

- Touchdowns and Total yards
- Yards per attempt and Total yards
